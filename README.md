## An MCP server for Multimodal Input

This is a prototype stage demonstration of a multimodal MCP server that currently has three modality inputs -
1. Text
2. Image
3. Audio
The first one is just simple but let's discuss the next two in detail:-


## 1. Image Modality
Here we are doing two things
1. Reading text from image if any
2. Captioning the image using an opensource model


## 2. Audio Modality
Similarly here we're doing
1. Converting audio to text if any
2. Using an open source model to characterize or classify the background noise
